Flask Mega Tutorial

This repo was created while working my way through the Flask Mega Tutorial, by Miguel Grinberg.
While completing the different chapters, Miguel would mention at the end to 'add these files to your repo'. After several chapters I took his advice and decded to learn/practice managing a project on GitHub while I worked my way through the tutorial.
Let me say that the tutorial was a great experience. It seems that I was looking at the first version of it, and he has created an updated version with more videos and newwer versions of everything.  The outline looks very similar, but it is behind a pay-wall, so I can't say I know any more about it than that.
Here is a link to the tutorial I followed: [The Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).
